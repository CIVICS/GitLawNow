## This Project

* This README file is the first entry point to the code in this GitHub Repository. For this exercise we use JavaScript to retrieve, process and get answers from a [consumer finance data set](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.consumerfinance.gov/jhzv-w97w) freely available through a data.gov public information resource site.  

* This repository contains:

1. The file named [Complaints.js](Complaints.js) which contains the JavaScript code we will use and work with.
2. The file named [Exercise.md](Exercise.md) describes how to use JavaScript to fetch and work with legal data.
3. The file named [Essential JavaScript] (link coming soon) is a draft book by [Christian Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christianmsmith)
